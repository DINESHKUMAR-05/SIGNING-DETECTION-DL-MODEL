This is a CNN model to identify the whether a person is signing or not, and it is presented via streamlit. We have made a dataset of images of people signing and unsigning and we have processed the images using cv2 library. We have achieved a accuracy of 96.70% with this model. The model predicts whether the person is signing or not using live camera access.
